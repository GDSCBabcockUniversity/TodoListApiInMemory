# TodoList App in Java (Spring Boot)

To run this application:

1. Navigate to `TodoAppApplication`, left-click, and select "Run".
2. Visit "http://localhost:8080/h2-console" in your web browser.
3. Fill in the details from the `application.properties` file. Note that data is persisted in memory, and it clears upon server shutdown. Hibernate, a built-in Java persistence storage running on SQL, is used, so prior knowledge of SQL is advised.

Once completed, your application should run smoothly. Test the API using Postman or any API testing client of your choice. Feel free to contribute updates or suggestions to this project! :)
